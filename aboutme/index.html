    <h2>Juan Suarez</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, </p>
     <p>I really like programming. I love to play the guitar and ukelele. I like to spend time with my family. I love sports, specially soccer. I am not married. But, I have a girlfriend.</p>
     <p>I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. I love to study online, because I can save a lot of time. I expect to learn and create new projects on the web</p>
     <p>I have been memeber of the Church, since I was a child. I think I have a different favorite scripture every moment of my life.</p>
